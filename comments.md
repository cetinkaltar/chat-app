## Remarks

* Inconsistent semicolon usage in JS (either omit them or always use)
* Noisy console.log calls left in source (last message)
* Would be nice if work features would have been organized by commit, not all with one huge commit
* UI linting errors would have been nice to clear before presenting solution
* Although not requested by us in the assignment, tests should still be on the mind of the developer
(they also help in development so you don't have to test some behavior through the running app)
